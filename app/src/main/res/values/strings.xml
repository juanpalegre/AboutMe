    <string name="bio_description"> Hi,
\n\nMy name is Juan Pablo and it´s really nice to meet you.
\n\nIn this app you are reading, my intention is to express some of my skills, abilities, hobbies and things that are important to me you know.
\n\nFirst, you have to know that I´m 33 years old, and I never (after school) stop working and learning. However, I never work in software programming, and that is because I´m a school teacher, who loves teaching, but some time ago found in programming the future of most systems and environments.
And most important thing… I love it.
\n\nI really consider myself as responsable person, knowing how to work in a group team, how to hear and make positive contributions whit knowledge and cretivity.
\n\nI love sports, read, and pass the time whit my family and friends.
\n\nAs I say before, it´s really nice to meet you!</string>
    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.
\n\nI love fish.
\n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n
